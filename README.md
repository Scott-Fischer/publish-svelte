# publish-svelte
publish-svelte or pubs is a cli tool to easily compile, bundle and publish svelte components to npm. 
The bundle will contain both svelte files and vanilla js files, so they can run everywhere.  

#### Installation 
```text
npm install -g publish-svelte
``` 

#### Usage
Publish your svelte component to npm:

```text
pubs ./MySvelteComponent.svelte
```

This will compile and bundle the svelte component in a format so it can be used with vanilla js and in svelte projects.
